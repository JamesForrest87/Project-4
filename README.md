# Project-4
# Introduction

The analysis aims to delve into the interplay between sperm quality, fertility rates, and demographic factors to understand their significance in global population dynamics. Recognizing the importance of comprehending trends on a country level and across genders is pivotal in shaping effective population policies.

SQL
Tableau (Graphs)
Google Colab

# Objectives

Analyze historical trends in female fertility ages globally and regionally.
Investigate factors influencing male sperm quality through demographic variables.
Assess the implications of these findings on population growth.

# Methodology
## Data Collection
CSV files from Kaggle and worldbank.org
Male fertility data source: Kaggle Male Fertility Patients Survey Dataset
Collect socio-economic factors influencing sperm quality including Religion, Ethnicity, Marital Status, Number of Children, Marriage Period, Education, Employment Status, Working Period, Income, and Sperm quality.
Conduct machine learning analysis to discern trends and patterns in sperm quality across demographics.
Utilize Tableau for visual analysis exploring relationships between countries and birthrates.
Compare fertility age trends across regions, countries, and time periods.
Evaluate the impact of changing fertility age ranges on population growth rates, family structures, and healthcare needs.

# Expected Outcomes
Identification of demographic factors affecting sperm quality.
Comprehensive analysis of historical and current birthrate trends.
Utilization of regression analysis and machine learning to predict future births per 1,000 people.
Insights into the implications of fertility age trends on population dynamics and policy formulation.
Data collection and preprocessing covering the period from 1950 to the 2020s.
